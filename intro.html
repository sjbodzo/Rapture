<span>Welcome to Rapture, a class project inspired by Dr. Tamer Kahveci for the course
    CAP5510 at the University of Florida. This project serves to teach me the basics
    of Javascript, 3D modeling, protein sequencing, the PDB format, and HTML/CSS.
    In addition, I hope you learn a thing or two about how proteins are made, because
    knowing how they are composed tells us how a lot about how they function!</br></br>

    Proteins are composed of amino acids. Amino acids are themselves composed of atoms.
    Arguably the most important atom is known as the alpha carbon, which is bonded to a
    hydrogen atom as well as several groups. These groups are the amino group, the
    carboxyl group, and what is called the R group. The seasoned chemist will recognize
    these are important groups in organic molecules. Often these groups, when present,
     may dictate how a molecule reacts and the chemistry it is involved in.  (The R group is special because it
    refers to a collection of atoms that uniquely identifies each amino acid.) You can
    view the structure of some of the 20 common amino acids (as well as their general structure)
    <a href="common_aa.html">here</a>.</br></br>

    The carboxyl group of one amino acid connects to the next amino acid's amino group.
    This means that amino acids can link together and connect in long chains. To visualize
    the general structure of what these repeating units look like you can view my sequence
    input visualizer. This allows you to input a regular [valid] sequence of up to 20 amino
    acids that are then shown to you, color coded, in three dimensional space. Valid input
    is constituted as one of the 20 common amino acids mentioned previously, using their single
    letter abbreviations. The sequence input visualizer is available <a href="seq_input_modeling.html">here</a>.</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>^ Note that this particular tool is currently not functioning properly. Consider it under construction!</b></br></br>

    There are several prominent file formats used in bioinformatics, including the FASTA format
    as well as PDB, FASTQ, SFF, GCG, et cetera. The PDB file format is of particular interest,
    as it is included for an impressive collection of proteins freely available to us at the
    RCSB Protein Data Bank website (rcsb.org). PDB files commonly store a rich swath of data
    for us to analyze and work with. To view the proteins represented in PDB files you can use
    my File Input Visualization tool. This tool takes input from a local PDB file, parses the
    information contained inside, and shows you a three dimensional representation of the protein.
    This tool is available <a href="file_input_visualizer.html">here</a>.</br></br>
