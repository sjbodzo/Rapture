                        <h3> <b>Title: Visualizing Proteins Using WebGL </b><br> <br> </h3>
                        Team Member(s): Stephen Jess Bodzo <br> <br>


                        Abstract: Proteins are composed of amino acids connected via peptide bonds. This project will lead to creation of a tool that will be capable of taking a given sequence of amino acids and visualizing them in three dimensions. The goal is for the end user to put in simple sequences of amino acids, or to parse a file that provides (x,y,z) coordinate information for each amino acid, and render that visually in the browser pane. Additionally, I hope to provide the user with a ball and stick model of the common 20 amino acids that they can interact with. Both the visualized protein and the amino acid models should have rotational as well as zooming capabilities. <br> <br>

                        Plan of Action : My first step is research, and I am currently reading a book on how to program using WebGL and HTML5. This will enable me to understand representing the data in the browser. I am also studying Javascript since I do not know that either, and will need it to implement logic (for the different amino acid models for example). I plan to began researching protein fold prediction models soon, so that in the case of being only given a string of amino acids without coordinates recorded, I can use simple predictive algorithms to show folding. At the same time I will begin coding and experimenting to get familiar with the technologies. Then I plan to look at the different file formats for representing protein structures to figure out how to parse that information. Currently my plan is incorporate the pdb file format as the parsed data format of choice. <br> <br>

                        <b> What methods are you going to compare and how will you get them? </b> <br>
                         I am not comparing methods, so this question does not apply. I am developing an educational tool. <br> <br>


                        <b> Which datasets are you going to use and where will you get them from (links if possible)? </b> <br>
                         I will be using the Protein Data Bank (.pdb) database available via www.rcsb.org/ <br> <br>


                        <b> What kind of experiment will you run and what will you measure (e.g., time, score, p-value etc). </b> <br>
                         My project is not necessarily an experiment, but rather a visualization of proteins that helps the user understand the biological basis for protein shape (and thus function) by seeing how they're built, and how amino acids interact with each other within the protein's structure. <br> <br>


                        <b> List of papers you have (will) read for this project. </b> <br>
                        Currently there are no papers being read, however I am reading several technical books for learning the necessary programming, as well as scouring the Internet for information both about aspects of the coding and the biology. This includes a very large portion of research on protein fold prediction models and relative hydrophilicity/reactivity of given amino acids.
